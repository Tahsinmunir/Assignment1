                    I realize both are separately polarizing to two different
                    groups of people. They’re pretty important to me though.

                    you can make this giant pot and eat it throughout the week and it’s the
                    best thing to come into after being out in the cold.They’re pretty
                    important to me though.

                <h1>Mutton Curry</h1>
                <p>
                    The best cut of mutton to use for this recipe would be the mutton
                    curry cut. This cut comes with a wide range of pieces and has
                    bone-in pieces that drastically help improve the flavour of the
                    recipe.
