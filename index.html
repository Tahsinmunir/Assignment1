            <p>
                I like to eat and cook good food. I can cook many kind of dishes. I would be
                very happy to share my recipies with others.

                <p>
                    Fear fried foods no longer! Southern fried chicken, mozzarella sticks, crispy crab cakes--these are
                    the foods we crave but are afraid to indulge in (and are sometimes afraid to make). Fry Light, Fry
                    Right provides a long-awaited antidote to the healthy food doldrums: 120 easy, mouthwatering recipes
                    for foods with fried flavor and texture that are good for you, too! Elaine Magee, an anti-dieting
                    dietician, show us "recipe makeover" techniques that cut the bad stuff without cutting the flavor
                    and texture. Her seemingly decadent but actually quite sane almost-fried foods are sure to dazzle:
                    from appetizers like Coconut Shrimp with Mango Salsa to sides like Garlicky Ballpark Fries to nearly
                    sinless desserts like Devil's Food Donuts. And her techniques are simple, requiring little more than
                    a hot oven or pan, a very small amount of oil, and readily available ingredients.

                <h1>thick Soup</h1>
                <p>
                    Thick soups are soups that are thickened using flour, cornstarch, cream, vegetables and other
                    ingredients. Depending on how you thicken a soup, you can get different textures and flavours.
                    For example, a potage of boiled meat and vegetables results in a thick, mushy soup. Conversely, a
                    bisque is thickened with rice, which creates a smoother soup.

                <h1>Mutton Curry</h1>
                <p>
                    Mutton is a great -- as yet untold -- story with its deep impact on the landscape, history and
                    culture of these islands. This is its turning point. With current heightened public interest in
                    traditional and wholesome meats, now is the time for a serious revival in the popularity of mutton.
                    It once fed the nation and took pride of place on dining tables from peasants to royalty.
